# RSA

* Apply the decryption formula found in here [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Decryption)
* You have to calculate t,d and n
* t is calculated using p and q
* d is calculated through [Modular multiplicative inverse](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Mathematics/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm), using e and t
* n is calculated using p and q
* Decrypt c using d and n
